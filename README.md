# BookSearch
A web site that can do book search, support book reviews, and simply recommend several books based on users‘ preferences

it's is just an example, not even a full version.

i just want to ensure eclipse can commit and push my code to github this time

The project was completed in five days to deal with the inspection at six months ago

the initial goal of the Project was to create a system which can gather user's searching info , preference ,etc.
and find the relationship between them,so that the data of them can influence each other,then we can rerank 
the result of searching,and recommend something to users

i'm going to refactor it during winter vacation,i'm not sure whether i'll use mature frame（like Spring） or not

Data about books was crawled from DouBan,and the main way of searching books is to use douban's api,or Lunence
Most of them are not provided this time(including mod file of Word2VEC and all databases)

i use google's algorithm Word2VEC to get words' vector,and use words' vector to recommend books to user

recently ,i find it too difficult to do rerank or recommend part ,maybe three months later the core of rs will still be a low one
